The dataset you provided seems to be related to medical data, possibly for predicting heart disease. Let's break down the columns:

1. Age: The age of the patient.
2. Sex: Binary value where 1 represents male and 0 represents female.
3. Chest pain type: Categorical variable indicating the type of chest pain experienced by the patient. It could be typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, or asymptomatic.
4. BP: Blood pressure of the patient.
5. Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl.
6. FBS over 120: Whether fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dl (1 for true, 0 for false).
7. EKG results: Electrocardiogram results, possibly coded as 0, 1, or 2, representing different findings.
8. Max HR: Maximum heart rate achieved.
9. Exercise angina: Whether angina was induced by exercise (1 for true, 0 for false).
10. ST depression: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
11. Slope of ST: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (upsloping, flat, or downsloping).
12. Number of vessels fluro: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
13. Thallium: Type of thallium stress test measuring the heart's blood supply.
14. Heart Disease: The target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

Each row represents a patient, and the values in each column represent different attributes or measurements associated with that patient. These attributes are typically used in medical analysis and predictive modeling to understand factors contributing to heart disease and to develop models for predicting heart disease based on patient characteristics.
